Overview of the functest suites
===============================

Functest is the OPNFV project primarily targeting function testing.
In the Continuous Integration pipeline, it is launched after an OPNFV fresh
installation to validate and verify the basic functions of the infrastructure.

The current list of test suites can be distributed in 3 main domains::

 +----------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+
 | Domain         | Test suite     | Comments                                  |

 |                |                | and floatting IP                          |
 |                +----------------+-------------------------------------------+

 |                |                | compute, network and storage.             |

 +----------------+----------------+-------------------------------------------+

Functest includes different test suites with several test cases within. Some
of the tests are developed by Functest team members whereas others are integrated
from upstream communities or other OPNFV projects. For example,
`Tempest <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tempest/overview.html>`_ is the
OpenStack integration test suite and Functest is in charge of the selection,
integration and automation of the tests that fit in OPNFV.

The Tempest suite has been customized but no new test cases have been created.
Some OPNFV feature projects (e.g. SDNVPN) have written some Tempest tests cases
and pushed upstream to be used by Functest.

The results produced by the tests run from CI are pushed and collected in a NoSQL
database. The goal is to populate the database with results from different sources
and scenarios and to show them on a Dashboard.

There is no real notion of Test domain or Test coverage. Basic components
(VIM, controllers) are tested through their own suites. Feature projects also
provide their own test suites with different ways of running their tests.

vIMS test case was integrated to demonstrate the capability to deploy a
relatively complex NFV scenario on top of the OPNFV infrastructure.

Functest considers OPNFV as a black box.
OPNFV, since the Brahmaputra release, offers lots of potential combinations:

  * 3 controllers (OpenDayligh, ONOS, OpenContrail)
  * 4 installers (Apex, Compass, Fuel, Joid)

Most of the tests are runnable on any combination, but some others might have
restrictions imposed by the installers or the available deployed features.
