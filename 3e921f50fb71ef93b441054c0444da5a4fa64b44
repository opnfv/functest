      "message": "Should opera not use depedndencies as installers like compass, joid etc. Is there a logic as to which one will be used depending on Scnario too? Plus do we assume here that if you specify scenario and or installer the VNF Deployment will not be direct but through installers. Plus can we also have [all] installers so that code can use it based on scenario etc.",
