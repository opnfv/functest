All these functions seem to target for instances of testcasebase and its child classes.\nIn this way, there is no need to have a TCC instance globally used by Functest.",

      "message": "I am afraid I wouldn\u0027t accept your advice, there are few reasons for that\n1) Although it seems more like utility, but actually it means to parser testcases.yaml, an object\n2) if we put all methods in testcasebase.py, it will become a god class, growing bigger and bigger, finally unmaintainable, which will also violate the Single responsibility principle(SOLID principle), a class should be as simple as small and An-Object-Oriented\n3) it is not only used in testcasebase, run_tests.py as well\n\nBut you do remind me, maybe we can process it in another elegant way, which lets TestCaseBase to accommodate it, I will think about it. Thanks for your advice.",
