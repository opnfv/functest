It\u0027s the most recent Guideline and has a few additional capabilities.

      "message": "I know and I discussed this with Catherine. OPNFV Danube release is based on Newton. 2016.08 supports up to Newton, and 2017.01 supports up to Ocata, so I guess it would make more sense to keep 2016.08. \n\nWe will update it for the new OPNFV release though to the latest one supporting Ocata or Pike.",
