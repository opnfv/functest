      "message": "Hi, Steven. \n1. Do you plan to uncomment this lines in order to leverage the local image files directly? Offline should be supported by functest automatically without any configuration manually.\n\n2. Why must centos and ubuntu images with large size be used for snaps_smoke? As I know, these two large images are only for snaps_smoke and cirros related images are required for api_check and snaps_health_check, where the small cirros images can be added in add_images.sh\n\n3. If centos and ubuntu images are essential for snaps_smoke, could we add them to download_images.sh, which can download images online before and then use them offline by volume mapping?",

      "message": "1. This example could be removed, but I guess I do not understand how offline testing is being implemented. For SNAPS to support offline testing, it will need a data structure such as the one shown under snaps.images.\n2. There are 3 tests in the smoke suite that leverage centos and ubuntu. If this is problematic, those tests will need to be removed from functest.\n3. Yes, I agree those should be added to download_images.sh just as long as the Functest team agrees they want to keep those 3 tests that are affected. I believe they have value as I have seen pods act and perform differently with all three image types; however, those types of tests may be out-of-scope for Functest in general.",
