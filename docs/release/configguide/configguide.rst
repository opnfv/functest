Pulling the Docker image
------------------------
Pull the Functest Docker image ('opnfv/functest') from the public
dockerhub registry under the OPNFV account: [dockerhub_], with the
following docker command::

  docker pull opnfv/functest:<TagIdentifier>

where <TagIdentifier> identifies a release of the Functest docker
container image in the public dockerhub registry. There are many tags
created automatically by the CI mechanisms, and you must ensure you
pull an image with the **correct tag** to match the OPNFV software
release installed in your environment. All available tagged images can
be seen from location [FunctestDockerTags_]. For example, when running
on the first official release of the OPNFV Colorado system platform,
tag "colorado.1.0" is needed. Pulling other tags might cause some
problems while running the tests.
Docker images pulled without a tag specifier bear the implicitly
assigned label "latest". If you need to specifically pull the latest
Functest docker image, then omit the tag argument::

  docker pull opnfv/functest

After pulling the Docker image, check that it is available with the
following docker command::

  [functester@jumphost ~]$ docker images
  REPOSITORY     TAG             IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
  opnfv/functest latest          8cd6683c32ae  2 weeks ago  1.321 GB
  opnfv/functest danube.1.0    13fa54a1b238  4 weeks ago  1.29 GB
  opnfv/functest colorado.1.0    94b78faa94f7  9 weeks ago  968 MB

The Functest docker container environment can -in principle- be also
used with non-OPNFV official installers (e.g. 'devstack'), with the
**disclaimer** that support for such environments is outside of the
scope and responsibility of the OPNFV project.

Accessing the Openstack credentials
-----------------------------------
OpenStack credentials are mandatory and can be retrieved in different
ways. From inside the running Functest docker container the
"functest env prepare" command will automatically look for the
Openstack credentials file "/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds"
and retrieve it unless the file already exists. This Functest
environment preparation step is described later in this document.

WARNING: When the installer type is "joid" you have to have the
credentials file inside the running container **before** initiating the
functest environment preparation. For that reason you have to choose
either one of the options below, since the automated copying does not
work for "joid".

You can also specifically pass in the needed file prior to running the
environment preparation either:

  * by using the -v option when creating the Docker container. This is
    referred to in docker documentation as "Bind Mounting". See the
    usage of this parameter in the following chapter.
  * or creating a local file '/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds'
    inside the running container with the credentials in it. Consult
    your installer guide for further details. This is however not
    instructed in this document.

NOTE: When the installer type is "fuel" and virtualized deployment
is used, there you have to explicitly fetch the credentials file
executing the following sequence

  #. Create a container as described in next chapter but do not
     "Bind Mount" the credentials
  #. Log in to container and execute the following command. Replace
     the IP with installer address after the "-a" parameter::

       $REPOS_DIR/releng/utils/fetch_os_creds.sh \
       -d /home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds \
       -i fuel \
       -a 10.20.0.2 \
       -v
       ( -d specifies the full path to the Openstack credential file
       -i specifies the INSTALLER_TYPE
       -a specifies the INSTALLER_IP
       -v indicates a virtualized environment and takes no arguments )

  #. Continue with your testing, initiate functest environment
     preparation, run tests etc.

In proxified environment you may need to change the credentials file.
There are some tips in chapter: `Proxy support`_

Functest Docker parameters
--------------------------
This chapter explains how to run a container for executing functest
test suites. Numbered list below explains some details of the
recommended parameters for invoking docker container

  #. It is a good practice to assign a precise container name through
     the **--name** option.

  #. Assign parameter for installer type::

       -e "INSTALLER_TYPE=<type>"
       # Use one of following apex, compass, fuel or joid

  #. Functest needs to know the IP of some installers::

       -e "INSTALLER_IP=<Specific IP Address>"

       This IP is needed to fetch RC file from deployment, fetch logs, ...
       If not provided, there is no way to fetch the RC file. It must be
       provided manually as a volume

  #. Credentials for accessing the Openstack.
     Most convenient way of passing them to container is by having a
     local copy of the credentials file in Jumphost and then using the
     **-v** option. In the example we have local file by the name of
     "overcloudrc" and we are using that as an argument::

       -v ~/overcloudrc:/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds

       The credentials file needs to exist in the Docker container
       under the path: '/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds'.

     **WARNING:** If you are using the Joid installer, you must pass the
     credentials using the **-v** option:
     -v /var/lib/jenkins/admin-openrc:/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds.
     See the section `Accessing the Openstack credentials`_ above.

  #. Passing deployment scenario
     When running Functest against any of the supported OPNFV scenarios,
     it is recommended to include also the environment variable
     **DEPLOY_SCENARIO**. The **DEPLOY_SCENARIO** environment variable
     is passed with the format::

       -e "DEPLOY_SCENARIO=os-<controller>-<nfv_feature>-<ha_mode>"
       where:
       os = OpenStack (No other VIM choices currently available)
       controller is one of ( nosdn | odl_l2 | odl_l3 | onos | ocl)
       nfv_feature is one or more of ( ovs | kvm | sfc | bgpvpn | nofeature )
                If several features are pertinent then use the underscore
                character '_' to separate each feature (e.g. ovs_kvm)
                'nofeature' indicates no NFV feature is deployed
       ha_mode (high availability) is one of ( ha | noha )

     **NOTE:** Not all possible combinations of "DEPLOY_SCENARIO" are
     supported. The name passed in to the Functest Docker container
     must match the scenario used when the actual OPNFV platform was
     deployed. See release note to see the list of supported scenarios.

     **NOTE:** The scenario name is mainly used to automatically detect
     if a test suite is runnable or not (e.g. it will prevent ONOS test suite
     to be run on ODL scenarios). If not set, Functest will try to run the
     default test cases that might not include SDN controller or a specific
     feature

     **NOTE:** A HA scenario means that 3 OpenStack controller nodes are
     deployed. It does not necessarily mean that the whole system is HA. See
     installer release notes for details.


Putting all above together, when using installer 'fuel' and an invented
INSTALLER_IP of '10.20.0.2', the recommended command to create the
Functest Docker container is as follows::

  docker run --name "FunctestContainer" -it \
  -e "INSTALLER_IP=10.20.0.2" \
  -e "INSTALLER_TYPE=fuel" \
  -e "DEPLOY_SCENARIO=os-odl_l2-ovs_kvm-ha" \
  -v ~/overcloudrc:/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds \
  opnfv/functest /bin/bash

After the *run* command, a new prompt appears which means that we are inside
the container and ready to move to the next step.

For tips on how to set up container with installer Apex, see chapter
`Apex Installer Tips`_.

Finally, three additional environment variables can also be passed in
to the Functest Docker Container, using the -e
"<EnvironmentVariable>=<Value>" mechanism. The first two of these are
only relevant to Jenkins CI invoked testing and **should not be used**
when performing manual test scenarios::

  -e "NODE_NAME=<Test POD Name>" \
  -e "BUILD_TAG=<Jenkins Build Tag>" \
  -e "CI_DEBUG=<DebugTraceValue>"
  where:
  <Test POD Name> = Symbolic name of the POD where the tests are run.
                    Visible in test results files, which are stored
                    to the database. This option is only used when
                    tests are activated under Jenkins CI control.
                    It indicates the POD/hardware where the test has
                    been run. If not specified, then the POD name is
                    defined as "Unknown" by default.
                    DO NOT USE THIS OPTION IN MANUAL TEST SCENARIOS.
  <Jenkins Build tag> = Symbolic name of the Jenkins Build Job.
                        Visible in test results files, which are stored
                        to the database. This option is only set when
                        tests are activated under Jenkins CI control.
                        It enables the correlation of test results,
                        which
                        are independently pushed to the results datbase
                        from different Jenkins jobs.
                        DO NOT USE THIS OPTION IN MANUAL TEST SCENARIOS.
  <DebugTraceValue> = "true" or "false"
                      Default = "false", if not specified
                      If "true" is specified, then additional debug trace
                      text can be sent to the test results file / log files
                      and also to the standard console output.

Apex Installer Tips
-------------------
Some specific tips are useful for the Apex Installer case. If not using
Apex Installer; ignore this section.

In case of Triple-O based installer (like Apex) the docker container
needs to connect to the installer VM, so it is then required that some
known SSH keys are present in docker container. Since the Jumphost root
SSH keys are already known, easiest way is to use those using the
'Bind mount' method. See below for sample parameter::

  -v /root/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa

  NOTE: You need the "sudo" when creating the container to access root
  users ssh credentials even the docker command itself might not
  require that.

HINT! In case of Triple-O installers you can find value for the
INSTALLER_IP parameter by executing command and note the returned IP
address::

  inst=$(sudo virsh list | grep -iEo "undercloud|instack")
  sudo virsh domifaddr ${inst}

  NOTE: In releases prior to Colorado, the name 'instack' was
  used. Currently the name 'undercloud' is used.

You can copy the credentials file from the "stack" users home directory
in installer VM to Jumphost. Please check the correct IP from the
command above. In the example below we are using invented IP address
"192.168.122.89"::

    scp stack@192.168.122.89:overcloudrc .

Here is an example of the full docker command invocation for an Apex
installed system, using latest Functest docker container, for
illustration purposes::

  sudo docker run -it --name "ApexFuncTestODL" \
  -e "INSTALLER_IP=192.168.122.89" \
  -e "INSTALLER_TYPE=apex" \
  -e "DEPLOY_SCENARIO=os-odl_l2-nofeature-ha" \
  -v /root/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa \
  -v ~/overcloudrc:/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds \
  opnfv/functest /bin/bash

Compass installer local development env usage Tips
--------------------------------------------------
In the compass-functest local test case check and development environment,
in order to get openstack service inside the functest container, some
parameters should be configured during container creation, which are
hard to guess for freshman. This section will provide the guideline, the
parameters values are defaults here, which should be adjusted according
to the settings, the complete steps are given here so as not to appear
too abruptly.

1, Pull Functest docker image from public dockerhub::

    docker pull opnfv/functest:<Tag>

<Tag> here can be "brahmaputra.1.0", "colorado.1.0", etc.
Tag omitted means the latest docker image::

    docker pull opnfv/functest

2, Functest Docker container creation

To make a file used for the environment, such as 'functest-docker-env'::

    OS_AUTH_URL=http://172.16.1.222:35357/v2.0
    OS_USERNAME=admin
    OS_PASSWORD=console
    OS_TENANT_NAME=admin
    OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION=2
    OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
    INSTALLER_TYPE=compass
    INSTALLER_IP=192.168.200.2
    EXTERNAL_NETWORK=ext-net

Note: please adjust the content according to the environment, such as
'TENANT_ID' maybe used for some special cases.

Then to create the Functest docker::

    docker run --privileged=true --rm -t \
    --env-file functest-docker-env \
    --name <Functest_Container_Name> \
    opnfv/functest:<Tag> /bin/bash

3, To attach Functest container

Before trying to attach the Functest container, the status can be checked by::

   docker ps -a

to attach the 'Up' status Functest container and start bash mode::

   docker exec -it <Functest_Container_Name> bash

4, Functest environemnt preparation and check

To see the Section below `Preparing the Functest environment`_.

Functest docker container directory structure
---------------------------------------------
Inside the Functest docker container, the following directory structure
should now be in place::

  `-- home
      `-- opnfv
        |-- functest
        |   |-- conf
        |   |-- data
        |   `-- results
        `-- repos
            |-- bgpvpn
            |-- copper
            |-- doctor
            |-- domino
            |-- functest
            |-- kingbird
            |-- odl_test
            |-- onos
            |-- ovno
            |-- parser
            |-- promise
            |-- rally
            |-- releng
            |-- sdnvpn
            |-- securityscanning
            |-- sfc
            |-- tempest
            |-- vims_test
            `-- vnfs

Underneath the '/home/opnfv/' directory, the Functest docker container
includes two main directories:

  * The **functest** directory stores configuration files (e.g. the
    OpenStack creds are stored in path '/home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds'),
    the **data** directory stores a 'cirros' test image used in some
    functional tests and the **results** directory stores some temporary
    result log files
  * The **repos** directory holds various repositories. The directory
    '/home/opnfv/repos/functest' is used to prepare the needed Functest
    environment and to run the tests. The other repository directories
    are used for the installation of the needed tooling (e.g. rally) or
    for the retrieval of feature projects scenarios (e.g. promise)

The structure under the **functest** repository can be described as
follows::

            `-- openstack_utils.py


    (Note: All *.pyc files removed from above list for brevity...)

We may distinguish several directories, the first level has 4 directories:

* **commons**: This directory is dedicated for storage of traffic
  profile or any other test inputs that could be reused by any test
  project.
* **docker**: This directory includes the needed files and tools to
  build the Funtest Docker image.
* **docs**: This directory includes documentation: Release Notes,
  User Guide, Configuration Guide and Developer Guide. Test results
  are also located in a sub--directory called 'results'.
* **functest**: This directory contains all the code needed to run
  functest internal cases and OPNFV onboarded feature or VNF test cases.

Functest directory has 6 directories:
  * **ci**: This directory contains test structure definition files
    (e.g <filename>.yaml) and bash shell/python scripts used to
    configure and execute Functional tests. The test execution script
    can be executed under the control of Jenkins CI jobs.
  * **cli**: This directory holds the python based Functest CLI utility
    source code, which is based on the Python 'click' framework.
  * **core**: This directory holds the python based Functest core
      source code. Three abstraction classes have been created to ease
      the integration of internal, feature or vnf cases.
  * **opnfv_tests**: This directory includes the scripts required by
    Functest internal test cases and other feature projects test cases.
  * **tests**: This directory includes the functest unit tests
  * **utils**: this directory holds Python source code for some general
    purpose helper utilities, which testers can also re-use in their
    own test code. See for an example the Openstack helper utility:
    'openstack_utils.py'.

Useful Docker commands
----------------------
When typing **exit** in the container prompt, this will cause exiting
the container and probably stopping it. When stopping a running Docker
container all the changes will be lost, there is a keyboard shortcut
to quit the container without stopping it: <CTRL>-P + <CTRL>-Q. To
reconnect to the running container **DO NOT** use the *run* command
again (since it will create a new container), use the *exec* or *attach*
command instead::

  docker ps  # <check the container ID from the output>
  docker exec -ti <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash

There are other useful Docker commands that might be needed to manage possible
issues with the containers.

List the running containers::

  docker ps

List all the containers including the stopped ones::

  docker ps -a

Start a stopped container named "FunTest"::

  docker start FunTest

Attach to a running container named "StrikeTwo"::

  docker attach StrikeTwo

It is useful sometimes to remove a container if there are some problems::

  docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>

Use the *-f* option if the container is still running, it will force to
destroy it::

  docker rm -f <CONTAINER_ID>

Check the Docker documentation dockerdocs_ for more information.

Preparing the Functest environment
----------------------------------
Once the Functest docker container is up and running, the required
Functest environment needs to be prepared. A custom built **functest**
CLI utility is available to perform the needed environment preparation
action. Once the environment is prepared, the **functest** CLI utility
can be used to run different functional tests. The usage of the
**functest** CLI utility to run tests is described further in the
Functest User Guide `OPNFV_FuncTestUserGuide`_

Prior to commencing the Functest environment preparation, we can check
the initial status of the environment. Issue the **functest env status**
command at the prompt::

  functest env status
  Functest environment is not installed.

  Note: When the Functest environment is prepared, the command will
  return the status: "Functest environment ready to run tests."

To prepare the Functest docker container for test case execution, issue
the **functest env prepare** command at the prompt::

  functest env prepare

This script will make sure that the requirements to run the tests are
met and will install the needed libraries and tools by all Functest
test cases. It should be run only once every time the Functest docker
container is started from scratch. If you try to run this command, on
an already prepared enviroment, you will be prompted whether you really
want to continue or not::

  functest env prepare
  It seems that the environment has been already prepared.
  Do you want to do it again? [y|n]

  (Type 'n' to abort the request, or 'y' to repeat the
   environment preparation)


To list some basic information about an already prepared Functest
docker container environment, issue the **functest env show** at the
prompt::

  functest env show

  | Functest Environment info                            |

Checking Openstack and credentials
----------------------------------
It is recommended and fairly straightforward to check that Openstack
and credentials are working as expected.

Once the credentials are there inside the container, they should be
sourced before running any Openstack commands::

  source /home/opnfv/functest/conf/openstack.creds

After this, try to run any OpenStack command to see if you get any
output, for instance::

  openstack user list

This will return a list of the actual users in the OpenStack
deployment. In any other case, check that the credentials are sourced::

  env|grep OS_

This command must show a set of environment variables starting with
*OS_*, for example::

  OS_REGION_NAME=RegionOne
  OS_DEFAULT_DOMAIN=default
  OS_PROJECT_NAME=admin
  OS_PASSWORD=admin
  OS_AUTH_STRATEGY=keystone
  OS_AUTH_URL=http://172.30.10.3:5000/v2.0
  OS_USERNAME=admin
  OS_TENANT_NAME=admin
  OS_ENDPOINT_TYPE=internalURL
  OS_NO_CACHE=true

If the OpenStack command still does not show anything or complains
about connectivity issues, it could be due to an incorrect url given to
the OS_AUTH_URL environment variable. Check the deployment settings.

SSL Support
-----------
If you need to connect to a server that is TLS-enabled (the auth URL
begins with "https") and it uses a certificate from a private CA or a
self-signed certificate, then you will need to specify the path to an
appropriate CA certificate to use, to validate the server certificate
with the environment variable OS_CACERT::

  echo $OS_CACERT
  /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt

However, this certificate does not exist in the container by default.
It has to be copied manually from the OpenStack deployment. This can be
done in 2 ways:

  #. Create manually that file and copy the contents from the OpenStack
     controller.
  #. (Recommended) Add the file using a Docker volume when starting the
     container::

       -v <path_to_your_cert_file>:/etc/ssl/certs/ca.cert

You might need to export OS_CACERT environment variable inside the
container::

  export OS_CACERT=/etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt

Certificate verification can be turned off using OS_INSECURE=true. For
example, Fuel uses self-signed cacerts by default, so an pre step would
be::

  export OS_INSECURE=true

Proxy support
-------------
If your Jumphost node is operating behind a http proxy, then there are
2 places where some special actions may be needed to make operations
succeed:

  #. Initial installation of docker engine First, try following the
     official Docker documentation for Proxy settings. Some issues were
     experienced on CentOS 7 based Jumphost. Some tips are documented
     in section: `Docker Installation on CentOS behind http proxy`_
     below.

  #. Execution of the Functest environment preparation inside the
     created docker container Functest needs internet access to
     download some resources for some test cases. This might not
     work properly if the Jumphost is connecting to internet
     through a http Proxy.

If that is the case, make sure the resolv.conf and the needed
http_proxy and https_proxy environment variables, as well as the
'no_proxy' environment variable are set correctly::

  # Make double sure that the 'no_proxy=...' line in the
  # 'openstack.creds' file is commented out first. Otherwise, the
  # values set into the 'no_proxy' environment variable below will
  # be ovewrwritten, each time the command
  # 'source ~/functest/conf/openstack.creds' is issued.

  cd ~/functest/conf/
  sed -i 's/export no_proxy/#export no_proxy/' openstack.creds
  source ./openstack.creds

  # Next calculate some IP addresses for which http_proxy
  # usage should be excluded:

  publicURL_IP=$(echo $OS_AUTH_URL | grep -Eo "([0-9]+\.){3}[0-9]+")

  adminURL_IP=$(openstack catalog show identity | \
  grep adminURL | grep -Eo "([0-9]+\.){3}[0-9]+")

  export http_proxy="<your http proxy settings>"
  export https_proxy="<your https proxy settings>"
  export no_proxy="127.0.0.1,localhost,$publicURL_IP,$adminURL_IP"

  # Ensure that "git" uses the http_proxy
  # This may be needed if your firewall forbids SSL based git fetch
  git config --global http.sslVerify True
  git config --global http.proxy <Your http proxy settings>

Validation check: Before running **'functest env prepare'** CLI command,
make sure you can reach http and https sites from inside the Functest
docker container.

For example, try to use the **nc** command from inside the functest
docker container::

  nc -v opnfv.org 80
  Connection to opnfv.org 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!

  nc -v opnfv.org 443
  Connection to opnfv.org 443 port [tcp/https] succeeded!

Note: In a Jumphost node based on the CentOS family OS, the **nc**
commands might not work. You can use the **curl** command instead.

  curl http://www.opnfv.org:80
  <HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type"
  .
  .
  </BODY></HTML>

  curl https://www.opnfv.org:443
  <HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type"
  .
  .
  </BODY></HTML>

  (Ignore the content. If command returns a valid HTML page, it proves
  the connection.)

Docker Installation on CentOS behind http proxy
-----------------------------------------------
This section is applicable for CentOS family OS on Jumphost which
itself is behind a proxy server. In that case, the instructions below
should be followed **before** installing the docker engine::

  1) # Make a directory '/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d'
     # if it does not exist
     sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d

  2) # Create a file called 'env.conf' in that directory with
     # the following contents:
     [Service]
     EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/docker

  3) # Set up a file called 'docker' in directory '/etc/sysconfig'
     # with the following contents:
     HTTP_PROXY="<Your http proxy settings>"
     HTTPS_PROXY="<Your https proxy settings>"
     http_proxy="${HTTP_PROXY}"
     https_proxy="${HTTPS_PROXY}"

  4) # Reload the daemon
     systemctl daemon-reload

  5) # Sanity check - check the following docker settings:
     systemctl show docker | grep -i env

     Expected result:
     ----------------
     EnvironmentFile=/etc/sysconfig/docker (ignore_errors=yes)
     DropInPaths=/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/env.conf

Now follow the instructions in [`InstallDockerCentOS`_] to download
and install the **docker-engine**. The instructions conclude with a
"test pull" of a sample "Hello World" docker container. This should now
work with the above pre-requisite actions.
