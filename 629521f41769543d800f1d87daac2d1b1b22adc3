      "message": "This could perhaps be improved and made future proof since more installers will come; apex, juju and this conditional will grow.\n\nIf I were you, I would do something like below\n\n    if [[ \"$INSTALLER_TYPE\" \u003d~ ^(fuel|foreman|compass|apex|juju)$ ]]; then\n        echo \"Installer type is valid\"\n    else\n        error \"Invalid installer type INSTALLER_TYPE\u003d${INSTALLER_TYPE}\"\n    fi\n\nThere are other ways to do this obviously and above might not be the best one.\n\nApart from improving the conditional, as a general best practice, line length can also be shorter - some say this is kind of personal preference so I\u0027m not putting my preference here. Google shell style guide says 80 characters per line.\n\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml#Line_Length_and_Long_Strings",
