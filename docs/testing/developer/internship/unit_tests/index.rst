Overview:
=========
Functest project is developing and integrating functional test cases for OPNFV
and it is part of OPNFV since the beginning. Functest develops its own
testcases and framework. This framework includes several utility libraries. The
Project is growing rapidly with more features, tests added as per requirement.
It becomes the responsibility of every developer to maintain the integrity of
code i.e. new patch should not break the previous functionality of the project.
To automate this process of software development, we should write unit tests
and add them to CI so that when a new patch is ready to merge, we shouldn't
allow those which are breaking previous unit tests or decreasing the coverage.



Problem Statement:
------------------
The goal of the intership consists in creating unit test suites on Functest
code with good code coverage (>80%) and integrate it in continuous integration
in order to consolidate existing code.


Curation Phase
--------------
The curation phase was the first 3 to 4 weeks of the internship. This phase was
to get familiar with the functest code and functionality and explore the
solutions for unit testing in other projects and come up with the strategy for
writing unit tests in functest.

In this phase we decided,

  - Coverage should be 80%. There are some functions like __init__, getter,
    setter and other private methods for which writing unit test is a tedious
    job, so we are leaving these methods for now.
  - Do method wise testing for every module.
  - Use mock for external or third party services, system calls and other
    external library calls which could impact the behaviour of system during the
    run of unit test.
  - Add it in jenkins as passing criteria for patches.
  - Write tests in modular way so that it can help to serve as a form of
    documentation.
