      "message": "latest nc (nmap\u0027s netcat) command support https however, it requires \u0027--ssl\u0027 option. In addition, usual test lab does use self-signed certificate, so it also requires to include \u0027--ssl-trustfile \u003cpem file\u003e\u0027 option. Test lab does not signed key for it by 3rd-party hence it tends to use self-signed certificate for testing.\n\nCould you please let me know whether the diff does point it out, or another diff takes care of it?",
