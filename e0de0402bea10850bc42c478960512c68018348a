Logic is such a way that it waits for all the instance to boot up, by the time it is waiting for 4th VM other 3 vms might have sshd up and more over I perform ssh operations on VM\u0027s which booted first and hence I feel ssh failing is unlikely here and it will be additional check which might not be required. If you insist I can add that.",

It has to do with the security group rules which are under active development in OpenDaylight and sometimes break or with missing flows. When we go into the tests we need to ssh into the instances, so I think it\u0027s good defensive coding to check for ssh before we attempt that.",
