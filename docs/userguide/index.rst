   :maxdepth: 2


Introduction
============

The goal of this document is to describe the Functest test cases as well as
provide a procedure to execute them.

A presentation has been created for the first OPNFV Summit `[4]`_.

This document is a continuation of the Functest Configuration Guide`[1]`_ and it
is assumed that the Functest Docker container is properly deployed.

**IMPORTANT**: All the instructions described in this guide must be performed
inside the container.

.. include:: ./introduction.rst

The different test cases are described in the section hereafter.

VIM (Virtualized Infrastructure Manager)
----------------------------------------

vPing_ssh
^^^^^^^^^

Given the script **ping.sh**::

    #!/bin/sh
    while true; do
        ping -c 1 $1 2>&1 >/dev/null
        RES=$?
        if [ "Z$RES" = "Z0" ] ; then
            echo 'vPing OK'
            break
        else
            echo 'vPing KO'
        fi
    sleep 1
    done


The goal of this test is to establish an SSH connection using a floating IP
on the public network and verify that 2 instances can talk on a private network::

 +-------------+                    +-------------+

This test can be considered as an "Hello World" example.
It is the first basic use case which shall work on any deployment.

vPing_userdata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This test case is similar to vPing_ssh but without the use of floating ips
and the public network. It only checks that 2 instances can talk to each other
on a private network but it also verifies that the Nova metadata service is
properly working::

 vPing_userdata test case
 +-------------+                    +-------------+
 |             |                    |             |

 |             | Boot VM2 with      |             |
 |             | ping.sh as userdata|             |
 |             | with IP1 as $1.    |             |
 |             +------------------->|             |
 |   Tester    |                    |   System    |

 |             |  console-log VM 2  |             |
 |             |    If ping:        |             |
 |             |      exit OK       |             |
 |             |    else (timeout)  |             |
 |             |      exit Failed   |             |
 |             |                    |             |
 +-------------+                    +-------------+

When the second VM boots it will execute the script passed as userdata
automatically and the ping will be detected capturing periodically the output
in the console-log of the second VM.


Tempest
^^^^^^^

Tempest `[2]`_ is the reference OpenStack Integration test suite.
It is a set of integration tests to be run against a live OpenStack cluster.
Tempest has batteries of tests for:

  * OpenStack API validation
  * Scenarios
  * Other specific tests useful in validating an OpenStack deployment

Functest uses Rally `[3]`_ to run the Tempest suite.
Rally generates automatically the Tempest configuration file **tempest.conf**.
Before running the actual test cases,
Functest creates the needed resources (user, tenant) and
updates the appropriate parameters into the configuration file.
When the Tempest suite is executed, each test duration is measured and the full
console output is stored in a *log* file for further analysis.

As an addition of Arno, Brahmaputra runs a customized set of Tempest test cases.
The list is specificed through *--tests-file* when executing the Rally command.
This option has been introduced in the version 0.1.2 of the Rally framework.

This customized list contains more than 200 Tempest test cases and can be divided
into two main sections:

  1) Set of Tempest smoke test cases
  2) Set of test cases from DefCore list `[8]`_

The goal of the Tempest test suite is to check the basic functionalities of the
different OpenStack components on an OPNFV fresh installation using
the corresponding REST API interfaces.


Rally bench test suites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rally `[3]`_ is a benchmarking tool that answers the question:

*How does OpenStack work at scale?*

The goal of this test suite is to benchmark all the different OpenStack modules and
get significant figures that could help to define Telco Cloud KPIs.

The OPNFV Rally scenarios are based on the collection of the actual Rally scenarios:

 * authenticate
 * cinder
 * glance
 * heat
 * keystone
 * neutron
 * nova
 * quotas
 * requests

A basic SLA (stop test on errors) have been implemented.


SDN Controllers
---------------

Brahmaputra introduces new SDN controllers.
There are currently 2 available controllers:

 * OpenDaylight (ODL)
 * ONOS

OpenDaylight
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OpenDaylight (ODL) test suite consists of a set of basic tests inherited
from the ODL project using the Robot `[11]`_ framework.
The suite verifies creation and deletion of networks, subnets and ports with
OpenDaylight and Neutron.

The list of tests can be described as follows:

 * Restconf.basic: Get the controller modules via Restconf
 * Neutron.Networks

   * Check OpenStack Networks :: Checking OpenStack Neutron for known networks
   * Check OpenDaylight Networks :: Checking OpenDaylight Neutron API
   * Create Network :: Create new network in OpenStack
   * Check Network :: Check Network created in OpenDaylight
   * Neutron.Networks :: Checking Network created in OpenStack are pushed

 * Neutron.Subnets

   * Check OpenStack Subnets :: Checking OpenStack Neutron for known Subnets
   * Check OpenDaylight subnets :: Checking OpenDaylight Neutron API
   * Create New subnet :: Create new subnet in OpenStack
   * Check New subnet :: Check new subnet created in OpenDaylight
   * Neutron.Subnets :: Checking Subnets created in OpenStack are pushed

 * Neutron.Ports

   * Check OpenStack ports :: Checking OpenStack Neutron for known ports
   * Check OpenDaylight ports :: Checking OpenDaylight Neutron API
   * Create New Port :: Create new port in OpenStack
   * Check New Port :: Check new subnet created in OpenDaylight
   * Neutron.Ports :: Checking Port created in OpenStack are pushed

 * Delete Ports

   * Delete previously created subnet in OpenStack
   * Check subnet deleted in OpenDaylight
   * Check subnet deleted in OpenStack

 * Delete network

   * Delete previously created network in OpenStack
   * Check network deleted in OpenDaylight
   * Check network deleted in OpenStack


ONOS
^^^^

TestON Framework is used to test the ONOS SDN controller functions.
The test cases deal with L2 and L3 functions.
The ONOS test suite can be run on any ONOS compliant scenario.

The test cases are described as follows:

 * onosfunctest: The main executable file contains the initialization of
   the docker environment and functions called by FUNCvirNetNB and
   FUNCvirNetNBL3

 * FUNCvirNetNB

   * Create Network: Post Network data and check it in ONOS
   * Update Network: Update the Network and compare it in ONOS

     exit Router and check it
   * Update External Gateway: Update the External Gateway and compare it
   * Delete External Gateway: Delete the External Gateway and check if it's
     NULL in ONOS or not


Features
--------

vIMS
^^^^
The IP Multimedia Subsystem or IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) is an
architectural framework for delivering IP multimedia services.

vIMS has been integrated in Functest to demonstrate the capability to deploy a
relatively complex NFV scenario on the OPNFV platform. The deployment of a complete
functional VNF allows the test of most of the
essential functions needed for a NFV platform.

The goal of this test suite consists of:

 * deploy a VNF orchestrator (Cloudify)
 * deploy a Clearwater vIMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) VNF from this
   orchestrator based on a TOSCA blueprint defined in `[5]`_
 * run suite of signaling tests on top of this VNF

The Clearwater architecture is described as follows:

.. figure:: ../images/clearwater-architecture.png
   :align: center
   :alt: vIMS architecture



Promise
^^^^^^^

Promise provides a basic set of test cases as part of Brahmaputra.

The available 33 test cases can be grouped into 7 test suites:

    #. Add a new OpenStack provider into resource pool: Registers
       OpenStack into a new resource pool and adds more capacity associated
       with this pool.

    #. Allocation without reservation: Creates a new server in OpenStack
       and adds a new allocation record in Promise shim-layer.

    #. Allocation using reservation for immediate use: Creates a resource
       reservation record with no start/end time and immediately creates a new
       server in OpenStack and add a new allocation record in Promise
       shim-layer.

    #. Reservation for future use: Creates a resource reservation record
       for a future start time, queries, modifies and cancels the newly created
       reservation.

    #. Capacity planning: Decreases and increases the available capacity
       from a provider in the future and queries the available collections and
       utilizations.

    #. Reservation with conflict: Tries to create reservations for
       immediate and future use with conflict.

    #. Cleanup test allocations: Destroys all allocations in OpenStack.
