It\u0027s the most recent Guideline and has a few additional capabilities.

OPNFV Danube release is based on Newton. 2016.08 supports up to Newton, and 2017.01 supports up to Ocata, so I guess it would make more sense to keep 2016.08. \n\nWe will update it for the new OPNFV release though to the latest one supporting Ocata or Pike.",

      "message": "Ok, I see--this sounds fine then.  Just FYI in case this wasn\u0027t explained (but it probably was; Catherine\u0027s great!): vendors can apply for the OpenStack Powered (TM) program by testing against either of the two most current Guidelines (currently 2016.08 and 2017.01).  That means 2016.08 is a perfectly acceptable choice, but in six months vendors will have moved on to a newer Guideline.  The Newton release is covered in both of those Guidelines, and will continue to be covered for a couple more yet, so even if they\u0027re shipping a Newton-based product they\u0027ll continue to be covered by newer Guidelines.\n\n\n\nThanks again!",
