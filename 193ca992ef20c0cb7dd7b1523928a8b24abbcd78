I\u0027ll have to try and clean up the document in this respect in the next patch. I understand that each release has it\u0027s own independent version of document, but I will check with Jose.\n\nQuestion: In the context of this remark here, what do you mean by \"Brahmaputra specific features which will not be supported anymore in Colorado\".  I am not sure what features are in question here but I agree is some feature is supported in Brahmaputra and not in Colorado then it should not be mentioned in the Colorado document!",
