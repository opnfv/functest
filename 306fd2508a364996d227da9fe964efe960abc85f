      "message": "Cedric, I am just wondering what the difference between openstack_utils.get_endpoint and get_endpoint via keystone client which you recommended is. The session from keystoneauth1 is adopted by def get_endpoint in openstack_utils. Is it necessary to update it to use ketstone client? Or just keep it as it is?",

Here I would propose to simply keep the modifications related to CONST and to adapt git commit message as well (change should target only one task).\n\nI will modify it in another change if really needed.\n\nThank you.",
