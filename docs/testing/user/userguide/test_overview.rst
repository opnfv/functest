Overview of the Functest suites
===============================

Functest is the OPNFV project primarily targeting functional testing.
In the Continuous Integration pipeline, it is launched after an OPNFV fresh
installation to validate and verify the basic functions of the
infrastructure.

The current list of test suites can be distributed over 5 main domains:
  * VIM (Virtualised Infrastructure Manager)
  * Controllers (i.e. SDN Controllers)
  * Features
  * VNF (Virtual Network Functions)
  * Kubernetes

Functest test suites are also distributed in the OPNFV testing categories:
healthcheck, smoke, features, components, performance, VNF, Stress tests.

All the Healthcheck and smoke tests of a given scenario must be succesful to
validate the scenario for the release.

As shown in the above table, Functest is structured into different 'domains',
'tiers' and 'test cases'. Each 'test case' usually represents an actual
'Test Suite' comprised -in turn- of several test cases internally.

Test cases also have an implicit execution order. For example, if the early
'healthcheck' Tier testcase fails, or if there are any failures in the 'smoke'
Tier testcases, there is little point to launch a full testcase execution
round.

In Danube, we merged smoke and sdn controller tiers in smoke tier.

An overview of the Functest Structural Concept is depicted graphically below:

.. figure:: ../../../images/concepts_mapping_fraser.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Functest Concepts Structure

Some of the test cases are developed by Functest team members, whereas others
are integrated from upstream communities or other OPNFV projects. For example,
`Tempest <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/tempest/overview.html>`_ is the
OpenStack integration test suite and Functest is in charge of the selection,
integration and automation of those tests that fit suitably to OPNFV.

The Tempest test suite is the default OpenStack smoke test suite but no new
test cases have been created in OPNFV Functest.

The results produced by the tests run from CI are pushed and collected into a
NoSQL database. The goal is to populate the database with results from
different sources and scenarios and to show them on a `Functest Dashboard`_. A
screenshot of a live Functest Dashboard is shown below:

.. figure:: ../../../images/FunctestDashboardEuphrates.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Functest Dashboard


Basic components (VIM, SDN controllers) are tested through their own suites.
Feature projects also provide their own test suites with different ways of
running their tests.

The notion of domain has been introduced in the description of the test cases
stored in the Database.
This parameters as well as possible tags can be used for the Test case catalog.

vIMS test case was integrated to demonstrate the capability to deploy a
relatively complex NFV scenario on top of the OPNFV infrastructure.

Functest considers OPNFV as a black box. OPNFV offers a lot of potential
combinations (which may change from one version to another):

  * 3 controllers (OpenDaylight, ONOS, OpenContrail)
  * 5 installers (Apex, Compass, Daisy, Fuel, Joid)

Most of the tests are runnable by any combination, but some tests might have
restrictions imposed by the utilized installers or due to the available
deployed features. The system uses the environment variables (INSTALLER_TYPE
and DEPLOY_SCENARIO) to automatically determine the valid test cases, for each
given environment.

A convenience Functest CLI utility is also available to simplify setting up the
Functest evironment, management of the OpenStack environment (e.g. resource
clean-up) and for executing tests.
The Functest CLI organised the testcase into logical Tiers, which contain in
