                    VMTP is a small python application that will automatically
                    perform ping connectivity, round trip time measurement
                    (latency) and TCP/UDP throughput

                    Shaker wraps around popular system network testing tools
                    like iperf, iperf3 and netperf (with help of flent). Shaker
                    is able to deploy OpenStack instances and networks in
                    different topologies.
